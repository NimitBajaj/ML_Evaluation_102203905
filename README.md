# Best Predicted Model: Extra Trees Regressor

# Dataset:

<ul>
  <li>The dataset used in this analysis is Fuel_cell_performance_data-Full.csv.</li>
<li>The target variable for this model is Target5.</li>
<li>The dataset includes multiple columns, and other target columns (Target1, Target2, Target3, Target4) were dropped for the analysis.</li></ul>

# Data Preprocessing:

<ul>
  <li>Target columns other than Target5 were removed.</li>
  <li>The data was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.</li>
  <li>Normalization and transformation techniques were applied to scale the features and enhance model performance.</li>
</ul>

## Performance 
<ul>
  <li>R-squared for Extra Trees Regressor: 0.7714</li>
</ul>
